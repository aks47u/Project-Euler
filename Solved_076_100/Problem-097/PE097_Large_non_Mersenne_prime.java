/**
 * Large non-Mersenne prime
 * Problem 97
 * 
 * The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in
 * 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 26972593-1; it contains exactly
 * 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2p-1, have
 * been found which contain more digits.
 * 
 * However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains
 * 2,357,207 digits: 28433Ã—2^7830457+1.
 * 
 * Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
