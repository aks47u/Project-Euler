/**
 * Arranged probability
 * Problem 100
 * 
 * If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs
 * and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that
 * the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
 * 
 * The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking
 * two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and
 * thirty-five red discs.
 * 
 * By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000
 * discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would
 * contain.
