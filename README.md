<h2>About Project Euler</h2>
<h3>What is Project Euler?</h3>
<p>
	Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
	programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
	insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant
	and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills
	will be required to solve most problems.<br /> <br /> The motivation
	for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a
	platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and
	learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Who are the problems aimed at?</h3>
<p>The intended audience include students for whom the basic
	curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose
	background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things
	mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving
	and mathematics on the edge.</p>
<br />
<h3>Can anyone solve the problems?</h3>
<p>The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is
	inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will
	expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously
	inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but
	surely work his/her way through every problem.</p>
