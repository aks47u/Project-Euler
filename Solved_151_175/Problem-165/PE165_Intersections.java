/**
 * Intersections
 * Problem 165
 * 
 * A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints. By considering two line
 * segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities: the segments have
 * zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
 * 
 * Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the
 * case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or
 * of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of
 * the segments it is an interior point of both segments. We will call a common
 * point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true intersection point of L1 and L2 if T
 * is the only common point of L1 and L2 and T is an interior point of both
 * segments.
 * 
 * Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:
 * 
 * L1: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
 * L2: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
 * L3: (46, 70) to (22, 40)
 * 
 * It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection
 * point. We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies on L1
 * this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and L2 have no
 * common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection
 * point.
 * 
 * Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000
 * numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator.
 * 
 * s0 = 290797
 * sn+1 = sn√ósn (modulo 50515093)
 * tn = sn (modulo 500)
 * 
 * To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is, the
 * first line segment is given by:
 * 
 * (t1, t2) to (t3, t4)
 * 
 * The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be:
 * 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).
 * 
 * How many distinct true intersection points are found among the 5000 line
 * segments?
